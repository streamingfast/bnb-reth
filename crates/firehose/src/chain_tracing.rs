//! Chain-specific tracing configuration and the thread-local active-tracer handle.
//!
//! Some chains route value differently from mainnet Ethereum in ways the generic
//! [`crate::executor::FirehoseWrappedExecutor`] / [`crate::inspector::FirehoseInspector`]
//! cannot infer from the transaction stream alone:
//!
//! * **BSC (Parlia)** credits every transaction's gas fee (and blob fee) to the consensus
//!   `SYSTEM_ADDRESS` (`0xffff…fffe`) instead of the block beneficiary, defers the consensus
//!   "system transactions" found in the block body to the end-of-block finalize step, and sweeps
//!   the accumulated fees from `SYSTEM_ADDRESS` to the validator with direct (non-EVM) state
//!   writes.
//!
//! A chain integrator registers a [`ChainTracingConfig`] once at process startup (next to
//! [`crate::init_tracer`]); the generic executor wrapper and inspector consult it at the
//! relevant decision points. When no config is registered, behavior is mainnet-Ethereum.
//!
//! The second half of this module is the **active-tracer handle**: the block tracer guard
//! ([`crate::FirehoseBlockTracer`]) holds the global tracer mutex for the whole block, so
//! chain executor code that runs *inside* block execution (e.g. BSC's `finish()`-time system
//! transactions) cannot re-lock the global. Instead, the guard registers a thread-local
//! pointer to the tracer for its lifetime, and chain code emits through
//! [`with_active_tracer`].
